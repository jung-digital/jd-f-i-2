      <h1>Electronic Freight Management (EFM)</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Flatirons Two Role: Subcontractor</h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>The Electronic Freight Management (EFM) initiative is a USDOT-sponsored project that applies Web technologies that improve data and message transmissions between supply chain partners. It promotes and evaluates innovative e-business concepts, enabling process coordination and information sharing for supply chain freight partners through public-private collaboration.</p>
        <p>The goal is to provide a mechanism for sharing supply chain freight information that is simpler, cheaper, and more efficient to implement than traditional EDI, allows for all, but especially small to medium sized and less sophisticated, supply chain partners to access the information, and makes it easier to customize the flow of information between and among partners. Another goal of the initiative is to design a system to ensure that data is entered once but used many times, thereby eliminating data transcription errors. EFM aims to help companies replace paper trails with electronic information, freeing up human resources that were previously devoted to manual data entry.</p>

      <h2>Interdom LLC - Pride Logistics</h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
        <p>Interdom LLC is a third party organization offering rail services to the international and domestic shipping communities. Initially founded to provide intermodal services to steamship lines with no intermodal department to utilize double-stack train services, Interdom LLC business has evolved to allow any small and medium size transportation entity to benefit from intermodal transportation. Their customer/partners include steamship lines, non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC), freight forwarders, customs brokers, and supply chain owners. Interdom LLC services are offered nationwide.</p>
        <p>The participants for this pilot are Interdom and Pride Logistics. To initiate a shipment, Interdom orders trucking services from Pride; Pride sends status information to Interdom. At the end of the shipment, Pride sends an invoice to Interdom. Today these processes take place via fax, Email and phone. During the EFM pilot they will be automated by exchanging information via web services.</p>
        <p>Interdom uses a system developed by Flatirons Two called LOTS. Pride uses a Microsoft Access Database system. The interface between the existing systems and the web services and clients will take place through database extracts in the form of text files. Some activity at one of the trading partners will trigger a process that will create a text files and then trigger the web service client. The client will use the text file to format the appropriate UBL xml message and invoke a web service at one of the trading partners. The web service will map the xml message to a text file and trigger a process that will update the database with the text file.</p>
        <p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Interdom sends orders to Pride to move containers from origin to an intermodal rail terminal. This will be automated by using the EFM book consignment service. </li>
            <li> Status, rail arrival, pre-note, accept/reject, delivery, and invoice communications will also be automated via EFM web services. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Improved accuracy of data exchanges - including more complete information with respect to status, order, and invoices. </li>
            <li> Improved timeliness of all data exchanges. </li>
            <li> Reduced costs associated with conducting entirely manual exchanges. </li>
            <li> Reduced costs associated with correcting incomplete or incorrect data. </li>
            <li> Use of web services/automation of messaging reduces redundancy of effort. </li>
            <li> Sustained use of the EFM package after the pilot test concludes. </li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Interdom LLC - Agmark</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
        <p>Interdom LLC is a third party organization offering rail services to the international and domestic shipping communities. Initially founded to provide intermodal services to steamship lines with no intermodal department to utilize double-stack train services, Interdom LLC business has evolved to allow any small and medium size transportation entity to benefit from intermodal transportation. Their customer/partners include steamship lines, non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC), freight forwarders, Customs brokers, and supply chain owners. Interdom Partner's services are offered nationwide.</p>
        <p>The participants for this pilot are Interdom LLC and Agmark. Agmark sends orders through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. Interdom supplements the order information and then sends the order through Kleinschmidt to BNSF. EFM will enable Agmark to send orders directly to Interdom. Interdom will continue to send orders to the railroad through Kleinschmidt. As the container moves the railroad sends status information through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. During the pilot this process will be replaced by a direct feed from the railroad to Interdom using traditional EDI techniques. Railroads also send status information to Steelroads. Steelroads passes status information to Agmark. Since Interdom also has rail status information they can use EFM services to forward status to Agmark, eliminating their need to receive status from Steelroads.</p>
        <p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Agmark sends orders through Kleinschmidt to Interdom.This will be automated by using the EFM web services. </li>
            <li> Rail status information will also be automated via EFM web services. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Reduction in cost associated with order transfer (Interdom and Agmark). </li>
            <li> Reduction in costs associated with direct receipt of rail status (Agmark). </li>
            <li> Reduction in costs associated with the collection and transfer of EDI 322, status (Interdom). </li>
            <li> Sustained use of the EFM package after the pilot test concludes. </li>

      <h2>Express Systems Intermodal</h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
        <p>Express Systems Intermodal is a third party logistics provider, specializing in air freight supply chains. ESI helps international courier companies enter the Asian marketplace.</p>
        <p>Currently, ESI customers can retrieve tracking data for their shipments by calling a customer service representative or by logging into the ESI website and requesting specific rail status information by container. Flatirons Two will develop a smart phone application for the Droid operating system to be used in conjunction with web service technologies to allow ESI's customers direct access to container tracking via their smart phones. The container availability summary screen by city is another process that could be modified to utilize the smart phone / web services technology. This would allow ESI's customers to review specific container availability when they are outside their office on sales calls to their clients in order to know if they can sell specific lanes and reserve available equipment.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of this case study is to automate the invoicing process between ESI and one of their customers, Hammer. Currently, there are 50 or more invoices handled each week via manual process. The use of the EFM package to exchange the invoice will reduce the redundant data exchange and automate the process.</p>
        <p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Creation of Android phone application for container tracking and container availability. </li>
            <li> Use of EFM package to automate the invoice transaction between ESI and a customer (Hammer). </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Productivity advantages over the existing access methods by reducing the amount of time necessary to access the desired data. </li>
            <li> Increasing the availability of container information. </li>
            <li> Improved efficiency due to reduction in ESI time to relay tracking information that could be done directly by its customer. </li>
            <li> Sustained use of the EFM package after the pilot test concludes. </li>
          </ul>
