          The Cross-Town Improvement Project (C-TIP) was first conceived in the fall of 2004 at an Intermodal Freight Technology Working Group (IFTWG) meeting in San Antonio, and has since grown in both size and stature. The first iteration of the project consisted only of a high-level concept that incorporated an 'intermodal move database' for coordinating cross-town traffic to reduce empty moves between terminals, and loosely defined ideas for tracking intermodal assets and distributing information to truckers wirelessly. Through the application of the IFTWG's project vetting and preliminary benefit cost assessment methodology, the C-TIP project grew to incorporate all of the components below:
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Intermodal Move Exchange (IMEX)</i>
          <br> Facilitate the exchange of load data and availability information between railroads, terminal operators and trucking companies. The primary function will be to allow collaboration on defining pickup and delivery schedules and locations that maximize the potential for linking moves, and eliminating bobtail and empty moves.
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Chassis Utilization Tracking (CUT)</i>
          <br> Provide a means for chassis owners and users to accurately account for asset use, which is crucial for the allotment of fees, and to maintain the proper balance of chassis to support cross-town and other container deliveries.
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Real-Time Traffic Monitoring (RTTM)</i>
          <br> Provide a means for up-to-the minute information regarding roadway conditions, travel speeds, and predicted travel times to be captured and passed along to the trucking community. Using a combination of traditional roadway sensors, traffic probes (i.e., vehicles that report their progress while traveling on the roadways), and third party providers, RTTM will provide the traffic information necessary for drivers and dispatchers to make informed decisions regarding routing and departure times.
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG)</i>
          <br> The dynamic route guidance (DRG) engine of RTTM will utilize inputs from RTTM and a Geographic Information System (GIS) source along with simulation tools, to act as an intelligence tool to provide real-time visual routing around congested areas.
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Wireless Drayage Updating (WDU)</i>
          <br> Provide a means to wirelessly and inexpensively exchange information with drivers regarding trip assignments, traffic congestion information, trip status, and location information through a truck-mounted driver interface device (T-MDID).

            <i>--Case Study--</i>
            <br>
            <br> International Express Trucking (IXT) is an intermodal trucking company located in Kansas City, MO. IXT takes pride in providing a quality, dependable service tailored to fit individual company needs.
            <br>
            <br> Currently, IXT uses printed paperwork that is passed on to the drivers to dispatch orders. This is either handed to the driver or faxed. During this case study the dispatched orders will be recieved through a phone application. The driver will use the phone to request or refresh the daily dispatch. The phone will send a message to the server containing the driver ID, password, carrier and location. The server will send back the daily dispatch. The phone will delete any previous daily dispatch and store the new one. The phone will store the daily dispatch and display it to the driver on request. Unless the driver requests a refresh the display will always show the most recent daily dispatch. The phone will display a summarized list of all stops to the driver. The driver may select one of the stops to view details for that stop. The driver will be able to re-order how shipments are displayed in the daily dispatch. This order will remain in place until the driver refreshes the daily dispatch or does another re-order. The driver will use the phone to send status updates as stops are completed. First, the driver will select the stop he is working on. Depending on the type of stop and the profile settings the phone will display a screen in which the driver can change a small number of values and the date/time. The phone will send a message to the server containing the stop ID and status information.

            <i>--Case Study--</i>
            <br>
            <br> Pride is a Intermodal Trucking Company located in Chicago. It was founded in 2002 and services the Chicago and regional market.
            <br>
            <br> Currently, Pride uses the T-card system to dispatch orders to its drivers. Once an order has been placed with Pride it gets typed up into a T-card and placed on the T-card board. When the order is ready to be executed the dispatcher will email the driver with the order information. Once the order has been completed the driver will call the dispatcher to confirm the order has been completed. On completion, the dispatcher will terminate the order . Flatirons Two will develop a web application that will replace the T-card system. It will have sorting functions inside the application to help eliminate bobtail (truck operating without a trailer) miles. A phone application will also be developed to compliment the web application by replacing of all the manual labor required to dispatch and close an order. The orders will be sent via web services to the phone application.
