        <br>
        <br> Managing shipments as well as tracking equipment, is a labor-intensive and costly process in today's intermodal environment. Sifting through and setting up the shipment load through multitudes of rate classes and service levels of the various carriers is cumbersome. In addition, variables such as origin/destination, service and equipment type, equipment availability, customers, quote type, etc., create an incredibly complex operation.
        <br>
        <br> That's why Flatirons Two, Inc. created Transportation Logistics Management System (TLMS&trade;). TLMS&trade; provides transportation carriers the ability to automate the process for shipping across multiple modes resulting in significant cost and time savings as well as higher customer service and greater revenue opportunities.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How It Works</b>
        <br>
        <br/> Through a comprehensive series of integrated components, TLMS&trade; mirrors the actual workflow: automating quotes and notification of orders to carriers, reserving equipment, enabling prioritized dray selection tracking and tracing of loads, and closure of AP and AR. Specifically, TLMS&trade; automates these shipping processes:
        <br>
        <br> - Rating
        <br> - Routing
        <br> - Ordering
        <br> - Tracking and transit time
        <br> - Freight bill auditing
        <br> - Equipment management
        <br>
        <br> In addition, TLMS&trade; is adaptable to your environment. Each component is easy to use and can be easily accessed through a user-friendly Web interface, available through the Application Service Provider (ASP) offering. Your customer service representatives, as well as your customers and vendors can track shipments and build reports via the Web, enabling you to provide an enhanced level of service. Through the ASP offering, start-up costs are significantly lower because there is no additional equipment to purchase, which leads to fewer burdens on your Information Technology staff. Everything is managed for you for a low monthly fee. In addition, the ASP offering also means TLMS&trade; will easily grow with your business.

        <b>Solution Features</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Accurate Rates</u></i> - Carrier contract rates are managed and kept current via updates, including mass updates. TLMS&trade; has the advanced ability to handle drayage and rail rates including accessorial charges (e.g., fuel surcharges) by carrier or locale. Powerful inquiry capabilities, as well as expiration dates and rate history enable better decisions. For rate negotiations, shipment performance reports are available to identify carrier volumes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Efficient and Effective Quotes</u></i> - Complex shipments involving various combinations of modes are easily handled through the flexible structure of TLMS&trade;. Quotes combine rates to provide a defined level of service (e.g., door-to-door may contain a dray/rail/dray) and contain effective/expiration dates, inquiry capabilities and full history.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Automatic Ordering Capabilities</u></i> - Advanced orders automatically set things in motion, notifying all parties. Features such as auto faxing, EDI rail billing, track and trace, exception reporting, powerful assessorial charge capture, customer pool support, etc., ensure the order is managed and executed as planned. Online interfaces to vessel manifests automate the order process with minimal human intervention.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Equipment Management</u></i> - Improved utilization of equipment is realized by providing you with three significant features - visibility, reservations and detention. Through TLMS&trade;, you have the ability to identify available equipment, reserve equipment for customers, and then track and calculate detention charges.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Administrative Ease</u></i> - Back-office activities are enhanced by features such as direct interfaces to your accounting system, historical reporting and reconciliation/freight bill auditing through EDI transaction set standards for auto-match of carrier and rail freight bills.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Higher-Level Customer Service</u></i> - Through a Web portal and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) capabilities, your customers are part of the process and can access their orders for shipment status and tracking - when they want to. Additionally, status reports are proactively provided by auto- fax as well as EDI (Shipment Status Messaging).
        <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Added Security</u></i> - TLMS&trade; provides security for your confidential information. User IDs and passwords protect access to your information. Multiple user level settings protect who can update, query and access specific functions.
        <br>
        <br>
