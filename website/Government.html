                  F-i-2 uses its depth of experience and expertise in freight transportation operations and information
                  technology to design and develop research projects focused on
                  improving efficiencies in freight movement and which include Intelligent Transportation Technologies (ITS)
                  tools. We do this by combining our knowledge with that of
                  the stakeholders that we interview, and the research that we perform on relevant literature and
                  technologies. We then assemble all this information into a proposal
                  that includes a coherent narrative, with potential benefits for all stakeholders, for a research
                  demonstration project that will improve the efficiency of freight
                  movement in the U.S. while reducing congestion and emissions. These projects may be either intra-modal, or
                  inter-modal.

                <div class="gov">
                  The Cross-Town Improvement Project (C-TIP) was first conceived in the fall of 2004 at an Intermodal Freight Technology Working Group (IFTWG) meeting in San Antonio, and has since grown in both size and stature. The first iteration of the project consisted only of a high-level concept that incorporated an 'intermodal move database' for coordinating cross-town traffic to reduce empty moves between terminals, and loosely defined ideas for tracking intermodal assets and distributing information to truckers wirelessly. Through the application of the IFTWG's project vetting and preliminary benefit cost assessment methodology, the C-TIP project grew to incorporate all of the components below:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Intermodal Move Exchange (IMEX)</i>
                  <br>
                  Facilitate the exchange of load data and availability information between railroads, terminal operators and trucking companies. The primary function will be to allow collaboration on defining pickup and delivery schedules and locations that maximize the potential for linking moves, and eliminating bobtail and empty moves.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Chassis Utilization Tracking (CUT)</i>
                  <br>
                  Provide a means for chassis owners and users to accurately account for asset use, which is crucial for the allotment of fees, and to maintain the proper balance of chassis to support cross-town and other container deliveries.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Real-Time Traffic Monitoring (RTTM)</i>
                  <br>
                  Provide a means for up-to-the minute information regarding roadway conditions, travel speeds, and predicted travel times to be captured and passed along to the trucking community. Using a combination of traditional roadway sensors, traffic probes (i.e., vehicles that report their progress while traveling on the roadways), and third party providers, RTTM will provide the traffic information necessary for drivers and dispatchers to make informed decisions regarding routing and departure times.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG)</i>
                  <br>
                  The dynamic route guidance (DRG) engine of RTTM will utilize inputs from RTTM and a Geographic Information System (GIS) source along with simulation tools, to act as an intelligence tool to provide real-time visual routing around congested areas.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Wireless Drayage Updating (WDU)</i>
                  <br>
                  Provide a means to wirelessly and inexpensively exchange information with drivers regarding trip assignments, traffic congestion information, trip status, and location information through a truck-mounted driver interface device (T-MDID).

                        International Express Trucking (IXT) is an intermodal trucking company located in Kansas City, MO. IXT takes pride in providing a quality, dependable service tailored to fit individual company needs.

                        <br>
                        Currently, IXT uses printed paperwork that is passed on to the drivers to dispatch orders. This is either handed to the driver or faxed. During this case study the dispatched orders will be recieved through a phone application. The driver will use the phone to request or refresh the daily dispatch. The phone will send a message to the server containing the driver ID, password, carrier and location. The server will send back the daily dispatch. The phone will delete any previous daily dispatch and store the new one. The phone will store the daily dispatch and display it to the driver on request. Unless the driver requests a refresh the display will always show the most recent daily dispatch. The phone will display a summarized list of all stops to the driver. The driver may select one of the stops to view details for that stop. The driver will be able to re-order how shipments are displayed in the daily dispatch. This order will remain in place until the driver refreshes the daily dispatch or does another re-order. The driver will use the phone to send status updates as stops are completed. First, the driver will select the stop he is working on. Depending on the type of stop and the profile settings the phone will display a screen in which the driver can change a small number of values and the date/time. The phone will send a message to the server containing the stop ID and status information.

                        Pride is a Intermodal Trucking Company located in Chicago. It was founded in 2002 and services the Chicago and regional market.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Currently, Pride uses the T-card system to dispatch orders to its drivers. Once an order has been placed with Pride it gets typed up into a T-card and placed on the T-card board. When the order is ready to be executed the dispatcher will email the driver with the order information. Once the order has been completed the driver will call the dispatcher to confirm the order has been completed. On completion, the dispatcher will terminate the order . Flatirons Two will develop a web application that will replace the T-card system. It will have sorting functions inside the application to help eliminate bobtail (truck operating without a trailer) miles. A phone application will also be developed to compliment the web application by replacing of all the manual labor required to dispatch and close an order. The orders will be sent via web services to the phone application.

                  The Electronic Freight Management (EFM) initiative is a USDOT-sponsored project that applies Web technologies that improve data and message transmissions between supply chain partners. It promotes and evaluates innovative e-business concepts, enabling process coordination and information sharing for supply chain freight partners through public-private collaboration.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The goal is to provide a mechanism for sharing supply chain freight information that is simpler, cheaper, and more efficient to implement than traditional EDI, allows for all, but especially small to medium sized and less sophisticated, supply chain partners to access the information, and makes it easier to customize the flow of information between and among partners. Another goal of the initiative is to design a system to ensure that data is entered once but used many times, thereby eliminating data transcription errors. EFM aims to help companies replace paper trails with electronic information, freeing up human resources that were previously devoted to manual data entry.

                        Interdom LLC is a third party organization offering rail services to the international and domestic shipping communities. Initially founded to provide intermodal services to steamship lines with no intermodal department to utilize double-stack train services, Interdom LLC business has evolved to allow any small and medium size transportation entity to benefit from intermodal transportation. Their customer/partners include steamship lines, non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC), freight forwarders, customs brokers, and supply chain owners. Interdom LLC services are offered nationwide.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The participants for this pilot are Interdom and Pride Logistics. To initiate a shipment, Interdom orders trucking services from Pride; Pride sends status information to Interdom. At the end of the shipment, Pride sends an invoice to Interdom. Today these processes take place via fax, Email and phone. During the EFM pilot they will be automated by exchanging information via web services.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Interdom uses a system developed by Flatirons Two called LOTS. Pride uses a Microsoft Access Database system. The interface between the existing systems and the web services and clients will take place through database extracts in the form of text files. Some activity at one of the trading partners will trigger a process that will create a text files and then trigger the web service client. The client will use the text file to format the appropriate UBL xml message and invoke a web service at one of the trading partners. The web service will map the xml message to a text file and trigger a process that will update the database with the text file.

                        The participants for this pilot are Interdom LLC and Agmark. Agmark sends orders through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. Interdom supplements the order information and then sends the order through Kleinschmidt to BNSF. EFM will enable Agmark to send orders directly to Interdom. Interdom will continue to send orders to the railroad through Kleinschmidt. As the container moves the railroad sends status information through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. During the pilot this process will be replaced by a direct feed from the railroad to Interdom using traditional EDI techniques. Railroads also send status information to Steelroads. Steelroads passes status information to Agmark. Since Interdom also has rail status information they can use EFM services to forward status to Agmark, eliminating their need to receive status from Steelroads.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Express Systems Intermodal is a third party logistics provider, specializing in air freight supply chains. ESI helps international courier companies enter the Asian marketplace.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Currently, ESI customers can retrieve tracking data for their shipments by calling a customer service representative or by logging into the ESI website and requesting specific rail status information by container. Flatirons Two will develop a smart phone application for the Droid operating system to be used in conjunction with web service technologies to allow ESI's customers direct access to container tracking via their smart phones. The container availability summary screen by city is another process that could be modified to utilize the smart phone / web services technology. This would allow ESI's customers to review specific container availability when they are outside their office on sales calls to their clients in order to know if they can sell specific lanes and reserve available equipment.

                        <br>
                        The second aspect of this case study is to automate the invoicing process between ESI and one of their customers, Hammer. Currently, there are 50 or more invoices handled each week via manual process. The use of the EFM package to exchange the invoice will reduce the redundant data exchange and automate the process.
