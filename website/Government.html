              F-i-2 uses its depth of experience and expertise in freight transportation operations and information
              technology to design and develop research projects focused on
              improving efficiencies in freight movement and which include Intelligent Transportation Technologies (ITS)
              tools. We do this by combining our knowledge with that of
              the stakeholders that we interview, and the research that we perform on relevant literature and
              technologies. We then assemble all this information into a proposal
              that includes a coherent narrative, with potential benefits for all stakeholders, for a research
              demonstration project that will improve the efficiency of freight
              movement in the U.S. while reducing congestion and emissions. These projects may be either intra-modal, or
              inter-modal.

              The Cross-Town Improvement Project (C-TIP) was first conceived in the
              fall of 2004 at an Intermodal Freight Technology Working Group (IFTWG)
              meeting in San Antonio, and has since grown in both size and stature.
              The first iteration of the project consisted only of a high-level concept
              that incorporated an 'intermodal move database' for coordinating cross-town
              traffic to reduce empty moves between terminals, and loosely defined
              ideas for tracking intermodal assets and distributing information to
              truckers wirelessly. Through the application of the IFTWG's project
              vetting and preliminary benefit cost assessment methodology, the C-TIP
              project grew to incorporate all of the components below:
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Intermodal Move Exchange (IMEX)</i>
              <br>
              Facilitate the exchange of load
              data and availability information between railroads, terminal operators and
              trucking companies. The primary function will be to allow collaboration on
              defining pickup and delivery schedules and locations that maximize the
              potential for linking moves, and eliminating bobtail and empty moves.
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Chassis Utilization Tracking (CUT)</i>
              <br>
              Provide a means for chassis owners
              and users to accurately account for asset use, which is crucial for the allotment
              of fees, and to maintain the proper balance of chassis to support cross-town
              and other container deliveries.
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Real-Time Traffic Monitoring (RTTM)</i>
              <br>
              Provide a means for up-to-the minute
              information regarding roadway conditions, travel speeds, and predicted travel
              times to be captured and passed along to the trucking community. Using a combination
              of traditional roadway sensors, traffic probes (i.e., vehicles that report their
              progress while traveling on the roadways), and third party providers, RTTM will
              provide the traffic information necessary for drivers and dispatchers to make
              informed decisions regarding routing and departure times.
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG)</i>
              <br>
              The dynamic route guidance (DRG) engine of
              RTTM will utilize inputs from RTTM and a Geographic Information System (GIS)
              source along with simulation tools, to act as an intelligence tool to provide
              real-time visual routing around congested areas.
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Wireless Drayage Updating (WDU)</i>
              <br>
              Provide a means to wirelessly and
              inexpensively exchange information with drivers regarding trip assignments,
              traffic congestion information, trip status, and location information through
              a truck-mounted driver interface device (T-MDID).

                    <i>--Case Study--</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    International Express Trucking (IXT) is an intermodal trucking company located in
                    Kansas City, MO. IXT takes pride in providing a quality, dependable service
                    tailored to fit individual company needs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, IXT uses printed paperwork that is passed on to the drivers to dispatch orders.
                    This is either handed to the driver or faxed. During this case study the dispatched orders will
                    be recieved through a phone application. The driver will use the phone to request or refresh the
                    daily dispatch. The phone will send a message to the server containing the driver ID, password,
                    carrier and location. The server will send back the daily dispatch. The phone will delete any
                    previous daily dispatch and store the new one. The phone will store the daily dispatch and display
                    it to the driver on request. Unless the driver requests a refresh the display will always show
                    the most recent daily dispatch. The phone will display a summarized list of all stops to the driver.
                    The driver may select one of the stops to view details for that stop. The driver will be able to
                    re-order how shipments are displayed in the daily dispatch. This order will remain in place
                    until the driver refreshes the daily dispatch or does another re-order. The driver will use the
                    phone
                    to send status updates as stops are completed. First, the driver will select the stop he is working
                    on. Depending on the type of stop and the profile settings the phone will display a screen in which
                    the driver can change a small number of values and the date/time. The phone will send a message
                    to the server containing the stop ID and status information.

                    Pride is a Intermodal Trucking Company located in Chicago. It was founded in 2002 and
                    services the Chicago and regional market.

                    <br>
                    Currently, Pride uses the T-card system to dispatch orders to its drivers. Once an order
                    has been placed with Pride it gets typed up into a T-card and placed on the T-card board.
                    When the order is ready to be executed the dispatcher will email the driver with the order
                    information. Once the order has been completed the driver will call the dispatcher to confirm the
                    order has been completed. On completion, the dispatcher will terminate the order . Flatirons Two
                    will develop a web application that will replace the T-card
                    system. It will have sorting functions inside the application to help eliminate bobtail (truck
                    operating without a trailer) miles. A phone application will also be developed to compliment the
                    web application by replacing of all the manual labor required to dispatch and close
                    an order. The orders will be sent via web services to the phone application.

              The Electronic Freight Management (EFM) initiative is a USDOT-sponsored project
              that applies Web technologies that improve data and message transmissions between
              supply chain partners. It promotes and evaluates innovative e-business concepts,
              enabling process coordination and information sharing for supply chain freight
              partners through public-private collaboration.
              <br>
              <br>
              The goal is to provide a mechanism for sharing supply chain freight information that
              is simpler, cheaper, and more efficient to implement than traditional EDI, allows for
              all, but especially small to medium sized and less sophisticated, supply chain partners
              to access the information, and makes it easier to customize the flow of information
              between and among partners. Another goal of the initiative is to design a system to
              ensure that data is entered once but used many times, thereby eliminating data
              transcription errors. EFM aims to help companies replace paper trails with electronic
              information, freeing up human resources that were previously devoted to manual data entry.

                    international and domestic shipping communities. Initially founded to provide
                    intermodal services to steamship lines with no intermodal department to utilize
                    double-stack train services, Interdom LLC business has evolved to allow
                    any small and medium size transportation entity to benefit from intermodal
                    transportation. Their customer/partners include steamship lines, non-vessel
                    operating common carriers (NVOCC), freight forwarders, customs brokers, and
                    supply chain owners. Interdom LLC services are offered nationwide.

                    The participants for this pilot are Interdom and Pride Logistics. To initiate a
                    shipment, Interdom orders trucking services from Pride; Pride sends status
                    information to Interdom. At the end of the shipment, Pride sends an invoice to
                    Interdom. Today these processes take place via fax, Email and phone. During the
                    EFM pilot they will be automated by exchanging information via web services.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Interdom uses a system developed by Flatirons Two called LOTS. Pride uses a Microsoft
                    Access Database system. The interface between the existing systems and the web
                    services and clients will take place through database extracts in the form of
                    text files. Some activity at one of the trading partners will trigger a process
                    that will create a text files and then trigger the web service client. The
                    client will use the text file to format the appropriate UBL xml message and
                    invoke a web service at one of the trading partners. The web service will map
                    the xml message to a text file and trigger a process that will update the database
                    with the text file.

                    carriers (NVOCC), freight forwarders, Customs brokers, and supply chain owners.

                    <br>
                    The participants for this pilot are Interdom LLC and Agmark.
                    Agmark sends orders through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. Interdom supplements the
                    order information and then sends the order through Kleinschmidt to BNSF. EFM will
                    enable Agmark to send orders directly to Interdom. Interdom will continue to send
                    orders to the railroad through Kleinschmidt. As the container moves the railroad
                    sends status information through Kleinschmidt to Interdom. During the pilot this
                    process will be replaced by a direct feed from the railroad to Interdom using
                    traditional EDI techniques. Railroads also send status information to Steelroads.
                    Steelroads passes status information to Agmark. Since Interdom also has rail status
                    information they can use EFM services to forward status to Agmark, eliminating
                    their need to receive status from Steelroads.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Express Systems Intermodal is a third party logistics provider, specializing
                    in air freight supply chains. ESI helps international courier companies enter
                    the Asian marketplace.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, ESI customers can retrieve tracking data for their shipments by calling
                    a customer service representative or by logging into the ESI website and requesting
                    specific rail status information by container. Flatirons Two will develop a
                    smart phone application for the Droid operating system to be used in conjunction with web
                    service technologies to allow ESI's customers direct access to container tracking
                    via their smart phones. The container availability summary screen by city is another
                    process that could be modified to utilize the smart phone / web services technology.
                    This would allow ESI's customers to review specific container availability when they
                    are outside their office on sales calls to their clients in order to know if they can
                    sell specific lanes and reserve available equipment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second aspect of this case study is to automate the invoicing process between ESI
                    and one of their customers, Hammer. Currently, there are 50 or more invoices handled each
                    week via manual process. The use of the EFM package to exchange the invoice will reduce
                    the redundant data exchange and automate the process.
